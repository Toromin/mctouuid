# Minecraft Whitelist Generator

This tool allows you to generate a Minecraft whitelist from a list of player names, using Mojang's API to fetch their UUIDs and outputting the whitelist in the required format.

You can either run it locally using a PHP script or use the online tool at [mctouuid.hausi.dev](https://mctouuid.hausi.dev).
